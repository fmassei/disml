used in many environments for many scopes, from configuration files to \
internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing."

		title="Introduction"
		text="\"Do It Simple Markup Language\" (abbreviated DISML) is a data \
serialization language designed to be human and machine friendly. \
This specification is both an introduction to the DISML language and the \
concepts supporting it; and also a complete reference of the information \
needed to develop applications for processing DISML. \
\
The main design goal was to keep DISML as simple as possibile. Some of the \
\"key\" features of other meta-languages are not even described in DISML, \
leaving maximum freedom to applications."
		section
			title="Goals"
			text="The design goals for DISML are: \
- humans can easily read and write DISML documents \
- machines can easily read and write DISML documents \
Where \"easily\" means, in both cases, in a fast and natural way."

			title="Terminology"
			text="This specification uses key words in accordance with RFC2119 \
to indicate requirement level. In particular, the following words are used to \
describe the actions of a DISML processor: \
- may This word, or the adjective \"optional\", mean that conformant \
processors are permitted, but need not behave as described. \
- should This word, or the adjective \"recommended\", mean that there could \
be reasons for a processor to deviate from the behavior described, but that \
such deviation could hurt interoperability and should therefore be advertised \
with appropriate notice. \
- must This word, or the term \"required\" or \"shall\", mean that the \
behavior described is an absolute requirement of the specification."
