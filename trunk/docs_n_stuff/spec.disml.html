<h1>1. Status of this document</h1>
<p>This is an intermediate working draft and is being actively revised.</p>
<h1>2. Abstract</h1>
<p>DISML is a human and machine friendly markup language, designed to be easily read and written by both users and software. It can be broadly used in many environments for many scopes, from configuration files to internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing.</p>
<h1>3. Table of contents</h1>
<h1>4. Introduction</h1>
<p>\"Do It Simple Markup Language\" (abbreviated DISML) is a data serialization language designed to be human and machine friendly. This specification is both an introduction to the DISML language and the concepts supporting it; and also a complete reference of the information needed to develop applications for processing DISML. The main design goal was to keep DISML as simple as possibile. Some of the \"key\" features of other meta-languages are not even described in DISML, leaving maximum freedom to applications.</p>
<h1>4. Goals</h1>
<p>The design goals for DISML are: - humans can easily read and write DISML documents - machines can easily read and write DISML documents Where \"easily\" means, in both cases, in a fast and natural way.</p>
<h1>5. Prior art</h1>
<p></p>
<h1>6. Relation to XML, JSON and YAML</h1>
<p></p>
<h1>7. Terminology</h1>
<p>This specification uses key words in accordance with RFC2119 to indicate requirement level. In particular, the following words are used to describe the actions of a DISML processor: - may This word, or the adjective \"optional\", mean that conformant processors are permitted, but need not behave as described. - should This word, or the adjective \"recommended\", mean that there could be reasons for a processor to deviate from the behavior described, but that such deviation could hurt interoperability and should therefore be advertised with appropriate notice. - must This word, or the term \"required\" or \"shall\", mean that the behavior described is an absolute requirement of the specification.</p>
